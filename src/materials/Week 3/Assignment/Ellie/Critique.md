# D3 Training Course: Assignment 2

Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

###Viz
*Good points:*

- Everything is very clear and big enough to read.

- The descriptive axis labels make the chart focused and objective to analyze.

- The chart title is straight forward and doesn't leave the audience guessing about the context of the data presented. 


*Bad points:*

- The data to ink ratio is a little low when you consider the chart lines in the background and clunky x-axis labels used.

- It seems repetetive to have the chart title indicate that the data is from last year and then include the year in the x-axis labels.

- The line series sometimes intersections with the bar chart data labels and makes the chart seem busy.

- The sales axis also doesn't start from zero, which biases the significance of the data somewhat since the range isn't as large as the data displays.


*My alternate design:*

My takeaway from the original visualization was to compare the relationship between the number of orders placed and the sales made from the product volume. For my alternative design I cut down on the data displayed and showed the ratio of the amount of sales made per one order of product placed. This way the audience can see the value of the product over the course of a year. I included floating text boxes to show the numbers that contributed to the ratio. This design doesn't have a double axis and is more straight forward without including both a bar chart overlaid with a line series.
