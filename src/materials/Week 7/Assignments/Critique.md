# Assignment 6

### Part 4
Review Viz Critique.png and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

*Good Points:*

- The map itself was visually pleasing with the clean appearance and large area labels.
- There was a good contrast between the data points, the green spaces (which are the parks presumably) and the map background. I like how the map is on a grayscale because it makes it easier to see the data points and compare them against one another.
- I thought it was pretty cool to see how many green spaces are in the NYC metropolitan area by looking at the areas filled in with green on the map.

*Bad Points:*

- The map doesn't include a title and therefore there's no introduction as to what the context or goal of the data visualization is.
- The map legend doesn't include explainations or titles as to what the keys indicate. Therefore it's hard to determine what's the significance of the data points or what the data is showing.
- I didn't understand why the bubbles in the legend were varied both by size AND by color when the colors weren't even displayed by the data points.
- I also didn't understand why both the bubbles and the color gradient keys had the same average value when they seemed to by displaying different parameters.

*My alternative chart:*

The main goal of my alternative design was to bring more context and completeness to the map visualization. The first thing I did to achieve this goal was add a title to the map that set up the focus of the data visualization, which I assumed was to analyze the popularity and usage of NYC's parks and monuments. I then mainly edited the map legend by adding explanatory titles to each legend key and then removing the 'average' labels since I didn't understand how both legend keys could have the same average. I then split up the bubbles and made them proportionate to the size of the actual data points on the map. I took away the bubble colors since it was confusing to have a key that displayed colors but then didn't utilize them in the data visualization. Since I thought this visualization could be targeted at tourists or locals looking to explore new parts of the city, I added floating text boxes that displayed the name of the park or monument and the address at which it could be found.
