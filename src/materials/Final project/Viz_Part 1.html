    Use the climate.json file to create a horizontal bar chart that shows yearly global temperatures. Your chart should meet the following criteria: 1) Use a D3 scale for the x axis, 2) The width of the bar should be related to the temperature and the each bar should have a label indicating which year that temperature represents, 3) The color of the bar should change each decade (you can choose whichever color you like for each decade), 4) The height of each bar should be 5 pixels with 2 pixels separating each bar, and 5) The chart should have a title, axes, and axis labels.
