# Assignment 4

### Part 3
Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

*Good Points:*

- The contrast of the blue and red bar coloring makes it easy to differentiate the two categories being compared.
- The large font for the "Democrats" and "Republicans" bar labels gives some context to the audience that this chart is a political comparison between democrats and republicans.
- The bars are somewhat complete with y-axis labels and data labels.

*Bad Points:*

- The two-way horizontal bar chart makes it difficult to compare the two bars since they are positioned opposite from one another.
- There is no chart title or x-axis label, which detracts from the completeness of the chart and doesn't provide much context to the audience for what the key takeaway messages or goals of the chart are.
- The y-axis labels bounce back and forth depending on which bar has the greatest value. This creates a busy appearance for the chart and often makes it difficult to focus on a particular bar-pair. 

*My alternative chart:*

To make the chart look less busy I opted for a simple clustered bar chart that groups the democrat and republican counts by the key words categories. This way the height of the bars can be compared side by side and makes the comparison more objective for the audience. I created distinct x- and y-axis labels and a chart title to make the chart more focused on the context of tha data. I also included a y-axis scale and omitted the data labels since I was mostly interested in which political party mentioned a word more and not necessarily how many each category contained.
