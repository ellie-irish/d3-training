# Final Project Overview

*The goals of the tool.*

The goal of the dashboard was to provide key stakeholders within the public health field access to data concerning children lead poisoning levels in the US. The dashboard allows the audience to see the data from differenet perspectives, such as on the state level, county level for some states, by blood lead level, and overall across the country. The data has distinct gaps due to policy change or state-specific reasons, and hopefully this visualization will better inform key stakeholders as to where more focus is needed for surveying lead poisoning in the US.

*Why you chose the type of tool you did.*

I chose to do an exploratory dashboard because I liked that all the data could be viewed in a concise window and provided an ease of access for the audience. A dashboard enables a viewer to explore the information in a digestible manner and see how the data compares across multiple visualizations. If a stakeholder wanted to see how their state data compared against national blood lead level averages, they could click on their state in the line chart and toggle the bar chart's year parameter to see the difference between the state's children blood lead levels and national blood lead levels. 

*How each feature contributes to meeting the visualization goals.*

The map visualization was the jumping off point since I wanted to represent blood lead levels across years and across state geography. Then I thought it would be interesting to create a chart that uses the same year toggle but only looks at US totals across all surveyed blood lead levels. That way the stakeholder could see how children blood lead levels have nationally changed over time. A bar chart was used for this because the data was grouped in blood lead level categories for a given year. Finally, I thought a state-specific chart would be beneficial for state stakeholders who wanted to learn more about how historically their state has faired with children lead poisoning. A line chart was most appropriate for this since it is mapping blood lead levels temporally. In addition, if the stakeholder wanted to seek even more information, a text box with hyperlinks is provided in the bottom right-hand corner.
