    Use your outcome assignment for Assignment 4, `air_quality.html`, to add interaction and transitions:
        <div>
        <br>
        <div> 
    1) Create three radio buttons on the html page labeled 'Sort By State', 'Sort By Emissions Descending', 'Sort By Emissions Ascending'
        <div>
        <br>
        <div> 
    2) Each radio button should when clicked result in the data being sorted either by state alphabetical order, emissions (high to low), or emissions (low to high) respectively
        <div>
        <br>
        <div> 
    3) After the data is sorted your chart should be updated correctly. This update should happen through the use of a transition that takes 1.5 seconds.
    NOTE: nothing on the chart should be re-drawn during this update/transition
        <div>
        <br>
        <div> 
    4) Once you have completed this, add a text box to your html file with a label of Delay(in milliseconds). The number in this box will be used so that it represents the number of millisecond delay that each element must wait before transitioning. This delay should be implemented so that all elements start and finish at different times according to their current order. Therefore, the first element should be delayed 1 x (number of millseconds in text box), the second element should be delayed 2 x (number of milliseconds in text box), and so on and so forth. The implementation should be fairly straight forward, if you sense you are hacking this together, take a step back and try to think through the solution based on everything you have used to date. 
    NOTE: This textbox should only take a number (you must handle in your javascript if it is not a number and alert the user that they must enter a number). You can do this by using the javascript alert method
