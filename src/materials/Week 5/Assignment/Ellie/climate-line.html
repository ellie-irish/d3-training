    Use the `climate.json` file (from your most last homework) to create a simple line chart shows yearly global temperatures. Your chart should meet the following criteria: 1) Use a D3 time scale for the x axis, 2) The y axis should represent the temperature and the x axis should have a label for each point indicating which year that temperature represents, 3) Each point in the line chart should be represented by a circle with a radius of 3 and have the same color as the line. The circle should be drawn over the line, and 4) The chart should have a title, axes, and axis labels.
