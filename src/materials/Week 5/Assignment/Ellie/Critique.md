# Assignment 5

### Part 3
Review `Viz Critique.png` and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

*Good Points:*

- The context of the data is well understood given the large chart title, axis label for the bar/area chart, and the floating text boxes with descriptions explaining events in Iraq that impact death tolls.
- The red color choice for the bar chart is quite compelling since it does look like blood.
- The different visualization techniques, like the bar chart, the map, the donut chart, and the bubble chart, for the different aspects of the data set make the visualization as a whole more engaging for the audience. 

*Bad Points:*

- Although the aesthetic of the chart is to make the bars look like blood, the upside down chart is actually hard to analyze. The significance of how the events in the text boxes affect the dips and drops in the chart is lost to me because orienting myself to the data is difficult.
- The grayscale coloring for the line chart, donut chart, and the map brings those data visualizations to the background and makes it appear insignificant for the audience to focus on.

*My alternative chart:*

I removed the upside bar chart and instead created a right-side-up area chart that has the two data series with a legend, which makes the chart more straightforward to look at and analyze. I kept the text boxes with the war event information since it brings context to the trends in the data. I kept most of the other charts (for space reasons) in the visualization and ideally would have recolored the grayscale charts with colors to make the visualizations pop and bring them forward rather than have them hidden in the background. I recolored the legend of the map to show what the color scale would look like. I thought the diversity of the chart elements in the original design was really effective for telling the data's story and I didn't want to lose that in my alternative design.
