    Use `population.json` to create a multi-line  chart that shows population by country. Your chart should meet the following criteria: 1) Use a D3 time scale for x axis and d3 linear scale for y axis, 2) There should be two lines on the chart one representing each country, 3) In addition, you should write your render code in a way that could scale to 15 countries easily, 4) You should not use a for loop and you should not have to rely on copying and pasting code, 5) Each line should be its own color and the chart should be accompanied by a legend indicating which line represents which country, and 6) The chart should have a title, axes, and axis labels
