# D3 Training Course: Assignment 1
## Ellie Irish

In this folder, you will find three data visualizations. Review each one and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.

### Viz 1

*Good Points:*
	- There was a nice range of colors used, which made it easy to differentiate which products had a greater value within the strategy groupings.
	- If the purpose of the chart was to compare the effect of different sales strategies, then the “total” line does a good job of showing which sales strategies led to a greater total value of products.
	- The title was helpful to articulate the intentionality of the chart. 

*Bad Points:*
	- What are the units being used to assess a “Product’s value” and the “total of amount.” The lack of units made it difficult to imagine the magnitude of the difference between bars. 
	- The y-axis labels were incomplete and didn't give much context for what the chart is trying to show. The “total of amount” label should be more descriptive as to what the “total” line signifies. It could be changed to “Value of all products.”
	- If the main purpose of the chart was to compare a product’s values across strategies, then this chart does not do a great job. The many colors positioned closely together makes it difficult to note trends across strategies for individual products.  

*My alternate chart:*
I wanted to combine the double y-axis into one since it added simplicity and easy viewing for the audience. I also added more descriptive x- and y-axis labels to provide clarity when viewing the chart and understanding the significance of the data presented. Instead of doing a side-by-side bar chart, I compiled a stacked bar graph to cut down on the busy look and bring clarity to the overall purpose of the chart, which was to compare a range of sale strategies based on the effect they had on the products' values. The modified chart doesn't have a total line data series since you can see what sales strategy was the most successful from comparing the total heights of the bars.



### Viz 2

*Good Points:*
	- The contrast in colors of adjacent stacked bars made it easy to differentiate the varying variables being compared.
	- The data labels on the stacked bars made it easy to recognize similarities and differences between variables within and across products.   

*Bad Points:*
	- The audience cannot easily discern which colors correspond to which legend variables due to the small font used for the legend and the number of colors used to display the different variables.
	- The y-axis is arbitrary in this chart since the top data label above each bar denotes the sum of the bars’ heights.
	- The use of both percentages and total counts as data labels, that don't seem to correlate with one another, made the chart inaccessible and hard to understand. It is also unclear what the red and blue percentages signify. Both of these factors detract from the focus of the chart and devalue the effectiveness of the numbers.
	- There is no chart title present, which is unfortunate because a title is usually a good starting point for introducing the purpose and goal of the chart to the audience. 

*My alternate chart:*
Since the purpose of including the percentages couldn't be ascertained, I deleted them from my modified chart. If they could tell a meaningful story about the data then it may be best to include the percentage data in their own chart. I kept the stacked bar chart look because from what I could tell the important take home message was not which manufacturers contributed more products, but instead which category of products sold the most units. I emphasized the total counts by placing them on top of the bars in large font. I noticed some of the original variable colors were very similar to each other so I changed some of the bar colors around to provide a wider color selection and easier viewing for the audience. 



### Viz 3

*Good Points:*
	- All of the charts, with the exception of the bubble chart, appropriately displayed the data in a way that trends can be easily seen.
	- The pumpkin data points in the “Annual Spending on Halloween” chart were topical and fun.

*Bad Points:*
	- The irregular positioning of the charts made it so there wasn’t a natural flow of information for the audience to follow. 
	- The color palette is very monochromatic and may be hard for people to differentiate the different charts and data points.
	- The bubble chart is not very effective because the bubbles are around the same size, except for the “greeting cards” bubble which doesn’t have a data label.

*My alternate chart:*
The original graphic had the charts positioned in a somewhat random way, which didn't allow of the audience to naturally move from chart to chart. I organized the placement of the charts in a more uniform pattern for ease of access and a better flow of information. I made the titles slightly bigger and varied the colors used so the data from one chart didn't blend in with data from another. The bubble chart used before wasn't an effective representation of the "Average Spending per Person per Item" data, so instead I used a bar chart with clear data labels on top of the bars. Thus, I think this graphic effectively presents the Halloween data in a more concise and intentional way than the original graphic.
